## Installation

```shell
npm install @mjburtenshaw/macmail
```

## Configuration

Add a `macmail.config.yml` to your project's root directory:

```yaml
# Required. An email address appended to BCC headers on production environments.
production_dev_recipient: dev.team@example.com

# Required. Overrides recipients with configured recipients (production_dev_recipient or my_email_address) when true to protect against false firings. This should be false in production environments.
override_recipients: true

# Required. The directory from which your application is being run from. Typically `src`, `dist`, `build`, etc.
source_dir: src

# Optional. An email address only used in non-production environments.
my_email_address: me@example.com

# Optional. A string. A companion to my_email_address.
my_name: Firstname Lastname
```

Our config will magically index files in your project ending in `.letter.tsx`.

See [Letters](#letters) for details on configuring letter templates. 

## Usage

[`composeMessage()`](src/mail/message.mail.util.ts) is the main function of the library:

### Example

```yaml
# macmail.config.yml

production_dev_recipient: dev.team@example.com
my_email_address: me@example.com
my_name: Firstname Lastname
```

```typescript
// Test.letter.tsx

import {
  Body,
  Container,
  Head,
  Heading,
  Html,
  Preview,
} from '@react-email/components';
import React from 'react';

type TestLetterProps =  {
  foo: string;
  bar: string;
}

const bodyStyles = {
  backgroundColor: '#ffffff',
};

const containerStyles = {
  paddingLeft: '12px',
  paddingRight: '12px',
  margin: '0 auto',
};

const h1Styles = {
  color: '#333',
  fontFamily:
    "-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto', 'Oxygen', 'Ubuntu', 'Cantarell', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif",
  fontSize: '24px',
  fontWeight: 'bold',
  margin: '40px 0',
  padding: '0',
};

export const LETTER_NAME = 'TestLetter';

export const requiredProps = ['foo', 'bar'];

export function TestLetter({ foo, bar }: TestLetterProps) {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Head />
      <Preview>This is a test letter</Preview>
      <Body style={bodyStyles}>
        <Container style={containerStyles}>
          <Heading style={h1Styles}>{`${foo}${bar}`}</Heading>
        </Container>
      </Body>
    </Html>
  );
}

export default TestLetter;

```

```typescript
// useMacmail.ts

import macmail, {
  type ComposeMessageOptions,
  type RequestedLetter
} from '@mjburtenshaw/macmail';

async function useMacmail(file: Express.Multer.File) {
  const sender = 'sender@example.com';
  const recipient = 'receiver@example.com'; // can support an array.
  const subject = 'This is a Test!';
  const requestedLetter: RequestedLetter = {
    name: LETTER_NAME,
    props: {
      foo: 'fizz',
      bar: 'buzz',
    },
  };
  const attachment = await macmail.mail.buildAttachment(file);
  const composeMessageOptions: ComposeMessageOptions = {
    blindCarbonCopy: 'a-discrete-someone@example.com', // can support an array.
    bodyContentType: mail.CONTENT_TYPES.TEXT_HTML,
    carbonCopy: 'a-relevant-someone@example.com', // can support an array.
    attachments: attachment, // can support an array.
  };
  const message = macmail.mail.composeMessage(
    sender,
    recipient,
    subject,
    requestedLetter,
    composeMessageOptions
  );
  return message;
}

```

## Library

### Mail

The purpose of mail utilities is to parse input in a way that's [Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) compliant](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321).

[`composeMessage`](src/mail/message.mail.util.ts) is the main function of the utility library.

#### Participants

`formatParticipants` is the main function of [the participant utilities](src/mail/participant.mail.util.ts).

The API uses participants defined using an address, e.g., `test@example.com`, or a username-address combination in JSON:

```json
{
  "address": "harry@hsww.edu",
  "username": "Harry Potter"
}
```

The username-address combination is preferred when possible.

When formatting for SMTP, we format the username-address combination like so: `Harry Potter <harry@hsww.edu>`.

We delimit multiple participants using a comma and space. It is valid to have a mix of addresses and username-address combinations in the same participant string.

#### Headers

`composeHeaders` is the main function of [the header utilities](src/mail/header.mail.util.ts).

SMTP requires the following headers:
1. From: an SMTP participant.
2. To: an SMTP participant or series of them.
3. Subject: a string.
4. Content-Type: a MIME type.
5. MIME-Version: 1.0.

> üö® *Google will override the From header with the authenticated client user when using them as a mail client.*

üî§ The header keys *should* be Pascal-Kebab case, but SMTP isn't picky about this.

ü§ñ We will encode the subject header in case it has stuff like emojis.

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è CC and BCC are optional headers. Content-Transfer-Encoding and a boundary are required, depending on the MIME type.

üéØ We want to prevent misfires to recipients when operating in non-production environments, so we will override the recipients with the developer's address if it's defined, otherwise a configured MACMAIL_PRODUCTION_DEV_RECIPIENT.

üïµÔ∏è We also want to add a configured MACMAIL_PRODUCTION_DEV_RECIPIENT as a blind carbon copy on everything we send out for auditing purposes.

#### Body

`composeBody` is the main function of [the body utilities](src/mail/body.mail.util.ts).

The body is required to render [a letter](#letters) merged with data. Preferably the body content type is HTML, but plain text is available.

If the email has mixed content, the body section must have its own Content-Type headers and boundary.

#### Attachments

üìñ In this context, we refer to **files** as inputs and **attachments** as outputs.

`composeAttachments` is the main function of [the attachment utilities](src/mail/attachment.mail.util.ts).

SMTP-compliant attachments contain the following information:
- The file name.
- The file MIME type.
- The file data.

We have a utility, [`buildAttachment`](src/mail/attachment.mail.util.ts) that accepts a Multer file and packages it as an SMTP-compliant attachment.

An attachment will always have a boundary because email's content type will always be multipart/mixed if it contains attachments. Whether or not the boundary is NEXT or END simply depends on if it is the last attachment.

### Letters

The objective of letter utilities is to facilitate the composition and formatting of letters to serve over SMTP.

[`render`](src/letter/letter.util.ts) serves as the main function of the utilities in this directory.

Letter templates are coded using [React Email](https://react.email/docs/introduction). They provide an elegant solution for creating email template on a server.

A letter template MUST have the following properties:
- A React function component as the default export.
- The same React function component as a named export.
- An array of strings matching the keys of required component props assigned to a constant named `requiredProps` as a named export.
- A PascalCase filename followed by `.letter.tsx`, e.g. `FooBar.letter.tsx`
